# Random Colored Blocks
Randomly sized and brightly colored blocks generated within ten responsive rows. This program is intended to be used as a background for a website or other similar space.

Also includes an informational paragraph element that displays the width of any block being hovered over by the mouse. And a "Generate" button that remakes the entire screen, at the user's request.
